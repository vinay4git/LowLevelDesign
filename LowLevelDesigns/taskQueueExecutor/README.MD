### DISTRIBUTED TASK QUEUE SYSTEM
```text
Design and implement a distributed task queue system. 
Publishers submit tasks that need to be processed asynchronously by a pool of workers. 
Tasks should be processed exactly once, and the system needs to handle millions of tasks per day with workers that might fail at any time.


1. Priority of the Task
2. Reliability of task to be finishing.
3. Auto Scale of the workers based on load
