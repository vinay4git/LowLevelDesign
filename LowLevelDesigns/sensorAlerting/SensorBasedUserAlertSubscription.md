### Sensor Based alert as per User alert subscription
```text
You are working for a company that installs hardware sensors in a given geo area. A sensor is a small battery-powered device that can be accessed over the internet and return its current reading to the caller. Each sensor has a unique identifier.

Requirements: We are asked to implement an alerting application that allows users to subscribe to specific sensors and receive the following types of alerts:
Alert once a sensor's reading is outside a specified range e.g. a sensor's temperature is below 60 F OR above 80 F.

Alert once a sensor's average reading is greater than a specified value over a desired time interval e.g. a sensor's average temperature is above 80 F over the last hour.
